⚡ Interesting facts: • Organization and commitment to what must be done. I like to have things clear and direct, with established levels of importance, always focusing on the quality of what is produced. • Preference for work environments with more fixed hours or with the possibility of establishing planning. • I find it easier in a private work environment, but I recognize the work situations that need to be developed in a team to make the work more productive and with quality. • I like to explore new ideas and goals at work, if I dispense with the importance of that work in more familiar and familiar contexts, adapting to each situation according to the domain. • I tend to keep the organization and attention to deadlines for not accumulating any services or miss delivery. • I always look for some way to improve my knowledge, regardless of request. -->
